        <h1>To my fellow 2020 Iccs:</h1>
        <h2 class="tab">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A greate mind once said: "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times." Allow me humbly say: "Whatever time it might be, let it be the only time we had." <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a glimpse of eye, we are seperated, to say the least, however temperated however meloncholy it may be, spreading all-over to this unbelievably amazing world. Three years, what a gold of all our time, we had been hands in hands all through as if it was a draeme. The world is a place with dangers, Ebola AIDS global warming and now the cov-19. But despite all the odds, we still managed to graduate. :BigApl) Now, we are done with sat and aps. And last but not least, we have realized that we are the most attractive class Ever. As a teacher of mine had put, One might say we haved aged well. Now it is our time to take on the world and to find and pursue our passions and to leave a legacy. William Shakespear once said: "some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greateness thrust upon them." In life, we can't always count on born great or have greatness thrust upon. But always remember that the opportunity to acheive greateness is within our grasp. Keep in mind that many of our social political leaders and heroes started their lives as an average person, as just one of you and me. Despite the failures and mistakes we will make, and although we may be average, we find that average can achieve greatness, whether recognized by the world or just a few. Greatness comes from our friends reaching out to us, those who go out their way to be thoughtful, the unsound heroes. Our time together here as senioritos will not be remembered by grades popularity likes or favourites, but by our relationships. What kind of person you were? -> 'These' are our legacies.<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ladies and Gentlemen, Stay Gold Stay Gold,
            be waiting for you cuz we shal met next time. so that next time we met, a little younger a little wiser will we be. Class 2020, it had been an honored and splendid three years for me to be with u, and from the bottom of my heart i wish u the very best.
